## 🚀 About Me

I'm a passionate backend developer with real-world experience building robust, scalable, and secure systems. I specialize in building APIs, microservices, and background services using modern and battle-tested frameworks like:

- ⚙️ **AdonisJS** (Node.js)
- 🛠️ **Laravel** (PHP)
- 🧩 **Yii2** (PHP)

Whether it’s for SaaS platforms, multi-tenant apps, or custom integrations, I love crafting elegant backend architectures that are clean, maintainable, and performant.
